# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to RegimeFrontierLab.

## Ground rules
- Keep claims model-bounded.
- Include reproducible scripts and receipts.
- Do not merge results without safety-envelope checks.

## Pull request checklist
- [ ] Added/updated script(s) under `scripts/`
- [ ] Added run manifest + receipts
- [ ] Included summary tables and CI where relevant
- [ ] Documented limitations and caveats
- [ ] Kept outputs deterministic enough for reruns (seed lists included)

## Commit style
Use concise prefixes like:
- `feat:` new experiment or capability
- `chore:` repo/docs/packaging
- `fix:` bug or metric correction
- `docs:` report or framing update
